Test for DART376
There are lots of useful places to get started. Some are in the course blog. This is one that's a bit hard to find:

This will let us do the basics of a comit, branch and pull in the browser. You still need to uderstand the CMD (Command) line on a PC or terminal in a Mac, though, so you could work locally (Git) and make changes to the repo on GitHub.

To creat code blocks, use three backticks (under the tilde key) and then add the name of the language (e.g. css), insert the code, then three more backticks on their own line.. This is an example:
```css

		#week:nth-child(even) {
			background-color: #dedede;
		}
```
Now you should be back in normal text.
You can do a lot of HTML things in Markdown (.md) files with similar syntax, but for most of them I'd just use HTML, e.g. to make  <strong>bold words</strong>.
